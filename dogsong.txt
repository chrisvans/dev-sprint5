Who walked the dog? Lost in the fog Squat down below Tongue to the snow Oh the coyote called He wants back his hide Well baby Where to start? Give me back my bones And maybe we can talk Between the sheets It was just you and me Screaming so loud Staring so proud Oh loud Who are you? Said the sun to the moon La da di da La da di da Eclipse, my hips are all yours tonight Hurry up, baby Hurry up, baby Or get out of my sight
